dotfiles
========

Ain't anything like home.

## First step

_getting the projet in the right place_


```sh
cd projects
git clone git@github.com:ArnaudRinquin/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

## Run the make tasks

```sh
make link
make brew
sudo make fish # needs sudo has it changes /etc/shells
make nvm
make osx
```
